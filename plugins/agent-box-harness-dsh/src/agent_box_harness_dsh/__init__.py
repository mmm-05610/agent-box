"""Third-party DeepSeek dsh Harness; runtime ownership remains with composition ports.

Work Order 43. The family currently consists of the production deployment
template only: the managed sidecar chain composes the pinned artifact's
``dsh --profile acp`` entry through the generic ACP registration, so no branded
provider or projection module exists - exactly the property the registry's
``driver`` field and the capability contract assert.

P-B (``approvals/PB-dsh-pilot-release.md``): this is the first per-Agent
integration package; the implementation moved here from
``agent_box_harnesses/dsh`` byte-for-byte (three declared edits live in
``production.py``). ``production`` is resolved lazily (PEP 562, same pattern as
the legacy facade and the M1-P-A① root package) so the package import never
pulls the renderer; ``dsh.<NAME>`` resolves on first use and returns the very
object from ``production`` (same module, not a copy). The legacy name
``agent_box_harnesses.dsh`` is a three-line alias of this package.
