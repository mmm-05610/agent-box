 * Session-first needs a more precise contract than `capabilities.sessions = true`.
 * Discovery, transcript observation and writer acquisition are independent properties: Codex can
 * read a rollout while its desktop/CLI writer owns the native thread, PI treats its journal as the
 * transcript authority, while Claude currently has no out-of-band history reader and therefore
 * reaches the native Session through ACP session/load.
 *
 * Keep uncertain behavior explicit. "unverified" is intentional here: the UI must not turn the
 * existence of a Session list or history loader into a promise that a second client can safely take
 * ownership of the Session.
