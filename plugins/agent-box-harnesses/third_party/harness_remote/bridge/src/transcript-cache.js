/*
 * The real memory bound is DEFAULT_MAX_WEIGHT. The entry cap only exists so a pathological number of
 * tiny transcripts cannot grow the map without limit.
 *
 * It used to be 8, which was sized for conversation-first: a user worked in a handful of
 * Conversations, so eight was generous. Session-first inverts that - Home lists every native Session
 * on the machine and invites hopping between them - so the ninth Session a user opened evicted the
 * first, and going back re-read that harness's journal or re-ran session/load from scratch. The cap
 * was doing the evicting while the weight budget sat almost entirely unused, which is why switching
 * between many Sessions felt slow for no visible reason.
 *
 * Keep the weight budget as the governing bound and let the entry cap sit far enough above normal
 * navigation that it stops being the thing that evicts.
