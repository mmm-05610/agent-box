/**
 * Gates for the OpenCode leg of increment 1 (D-0011): the tail calibration's verdict becomes a fact
 * the caller receives, instead of a line in an audit file nobody is required to open.
 *
 * Two layers, because the two claims are different:
 *
 *   ①–⑤ the five verdicts, asserted on the pure decision function. Reaching `completed`/`mismatch`
 *         through `prompt()` would need a live SSE subscription, which only `start()` opens — and
 *         `start()` is the host-spawning path this probe must not take (same boundary the existing
 *         Python probe states: "the unit probe must not spawn").
 *   ⑥   the verdict's *delivery*: one real `prompt()` call against a stub HTTP layer, asserting the
 *         `tail` object arrives in the turn result and carries lengths, never text.
 *
 * Nothing is spawned and no credential, model or OpenCode build is touched; `globalThis.fetch` is
 * replaced for the duration of the last test only.
