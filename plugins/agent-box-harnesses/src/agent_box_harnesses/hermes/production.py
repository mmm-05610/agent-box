"""Hermes production deployment template for the managed sidecar chain (non-secret).

This module owns the Hermes-specific parts of a production deployment: which
artifact directory carries the interpreter closure, how the reviewed native
configuration is projected into the confined guest home, where Hermes keeps its
own session store, and which environment variable carries the credential
reference.

It is deliberately *data*: the Server, Core, Worker and bwrap layers only ever
see the generic `runtimeArtifactMounts` / `projectionFiles` / `stateProjection`
/ `adapter` fields this template produces, and never a Hermes branch.

The native configuration (`deploy/hermes/config.yaml`) is byte-equal in content
to the configuration Work Order 42-D prepared (`hermesModelConfig()` in
`scripts/server-round1/model-validation-42d.mjs`): one provider block, the
user-confirmed product model `deepseek-flash`, the official DeepSeek root, a
64-token output ceiling, thinking disabled, and the lowest retry count the
harness supports (`agent.api_max_retries: 1`, i.e. at most two provider attempts
per prompt). A test asserts that equality, so the template cannot drift into a
second implementation.

Three measured facts shape this template, and all three are re-checked by the
production chain gate rather than assumed:

* **The native session store is a file inside the Hermes home.** Hermes keeps
  its authoritative session database at ``$HERMES_HOME/state.db`` (SQLite, with
  ``-wal``/``-shm`` beside it), not in a subdirectory. The deployment persists
  exactly one writable *directory* per Harness home, so ``HERMES_HOME`` is that
  persisted directory (``STATE_TARGET``) and the reviewed `config.yaml` is
  projected read-only *inside* it, at exactly ``$HERMES_HOME/config.yaml`` - the
  path Hermes itself reads. Nothing is materialized at run time any more: the
  reviewed file is a read-only mount, a write to it fails instead of forking a
  second configuration, and the projection is therefore a **protected state
  path** - it is excluded from every checkpoint and a checkpoint that tries to
  restore it is refused (see
  `plugins/agent-box-harnesses/deploy/hermes/bootstrap.py`, which now verifies
  rather than copies it).
* **Hermes 0.19's ACP surface has no model control this bridge can address.**
  Its adapter advertises the ACP `models` session state and implements
  `session/set_model`; it deliberately answers `session/set_config_option` with
  an empty `configOptions` list and returns no `configOptions` from
  `session/new`. The pinned upstream bridge selects a model only through that
  list, so *every* model value a deployment freezes is refused inside the
  sidecar with `Harness model is not available: <model>` before any provider
  request. This template therefore declares **no** product model control
  (`MODEL_CONTROL_ID is None`) and pins the model in the native configuration
  instead; the gate demonstrates the refusal explicitly so the limitation is
  recorded rather than papered over.
* **The model is declared through Hermes' own user-defined-provider kind, and
  that is deliberate.** `model.provider` reads `custom` and the configuration
  declares one `providers.custom` block holding the product's provider content:
  the official root, the `key_env` reference, the `chat_completions` transport,
  the model catalogue and `extra_body` thinking off. Hermes' built-in `deepseek`
  provider would instead rewrite the model id before the request
  (`hermes_cli.model_normalize.normalize_model_for_provider` ->
  `_normalize_for_deepseek`: only `deepseek-v<digit>...` ids and reasoner-like
  names survive, everything else becomes `deepseek-chat`), so the provider would
  receive a model id the product never declared. A custom provider passes the id
  through unchanged, which is what makes the wire value exactly
  `deepseek-flash`. The block key is the bare kind (`custom`, not
  `custom:deepseek`) because Hermes' ACP session store persists the *resolved*
  provider identity and resumes a session through it: with a `custom:<key>`
  reference a resumed session resolves no provider block and falls back to a
  placeholder credential (measured; without the restored base URL it would even
  fall back to Hermes' default OpenRouter root), while the bare kind resolves the
  declared block on both the fresh and the resumed path. Recorded cost of this
  declaration, measured and asserted rather than hidden: Hermes' resolved
  provider identity and its ACP model state read `custom` /
  `custom:deepseek-flash` (`NATIVE_PROVIDER_IDENTITY`, `NATIVE_MODEL_SELECTION`),
  and the model-metadata lookup no longer matches the built-in DeepSeek table, so
  the context window falls back to the heuristic 128,000 instead of 1,000,000.
  The endpoint, credential reference, transport, request body options, output
  ceiling and retry bound are unchanged; nothing proxies, patches or renames a
  model.

Nothing here reads, stores, or emits credential content: the API key is an
environment *reference* (`$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`) resolved by the harness inside the
sandbox, where the Worker materialized it.

#: Measured, and the reason the declaration is the bare kind rather than a

#: Production adapter environment. Every entry is here for a reason:
#:
#: * `PYTHONPATH` - the artifact's own site directory is the whole interpreter
#:   closure; nothing else may satisfy an import.
#: * `PYTHONNOUSERSITE` - the guest has no per-user site directory, and the run
#:   must not depend on any.
#: * `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE` - the artifact is mounted read-only, so Python
#:   must never try to write a `__pycache__` beside a module it imports.
#: * `HERMES_HOME` - the persisted native home (see `STATE_TARGET`); Hermes
#:   keeps `state.db` and the restored transcript there, and reads the reviewed
#:   `config.yaml` from `$HERMES_HOME/config.yaml`, which is exactly the
#:   read-only projection this template declares.
#: * `HERMES_IGNORE_USER_CONFIG` / `HERMES_IGNORE_RULES` - no ambient
#:   `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, memory or preloaded skills may reach a managed
#:   run; the projected configuration is the only configuration.
#: * `HERMES_SKIP_NODE_BOOTSTRAP` - never try to bootstrap Node/npm inside the
#:   sandbox.
#: * `HERMES_MAX_ITERATIONS` - the tool-iteration ceiling 42-D prepared, so a
#:   run cannot grow past it. The *output* ceiling is not declared here: the
#:   Server's deployment validation refuses a credential-shaped environment key
#:   (`TOKEN|SECRET|KEY|...`), and `HERMES_MAX_TOKENS` trips it on `TOKENS`
#:   (measured - `build_runtime_from_sidecar_deployment` raises
#:   `SIDECAR_DEPLOYMENT_INVALID`). The 64-token ceiling is therefore declared
#:   where Hermes reads it, in the projected `model.max_tokens`, and the gate
#:   asserts the value that actually reached the provider.
#: * `HERMES_MODEL` / `HERMES_INFERENCE_MODEL` / `HERMES_TUI_PROVIDER` /
#:   `HERMES_INFERENCE_PROVIDER` - the model and provider declarations 42-D
#:   prepared. Measured: the ACP entry point takes both from `config.yaml`
#:   (`model.default`, `model.provider`), so these are declaration-consistent
#:   rather than load-bearing; they are kept so the environment a managed run
#:   sees is the environment that was prepared. The provider value is the same
#:   `custom` declaration the configuration carries, so a path that ever
#:   consulted it could not silently resolve the built-in provider instead.
