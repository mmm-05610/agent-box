"""Reviewed offline gate asset for Hermes runs that must not leave loopback.

This is a test asset, deliberately NOT part of the production deployment: the
production template talks to the official DeepSeek root, which is what it
records. A gate that points Hermes at a local fake endpoint projects this file
read-only into ``/tmp/agentbox-home/sitecustomize.py`` and puts
``/tmp/agentbox-home`` first on ``PYTHONPATH``, so the gate - not the
production artifact - owns the ``sitecustomize`` CPython imports.

It does three things and nothing else:

1. It installs the AgentBox Python egress guard. Because Hermes is a Python
   program, the guard refuses a non-loopback destination in
   ``socket.connect``/``connect_ex``/``create_connection``/``getaddrinfo``
   *before* resolution or connection, so a refused attempt can never leave the
   guest. A fixed self-test probes a TEST-NET address at load time, which makes
   "the guard is loaded and fail-closed" an observation rather than an
   assumption. Every load, self-test and refusal is appended to the audit file
   named by ``AGENTBOX_EGRESS_AUDIT`` (the project workspace, so the host can
   read it back). Audit records hold host and port only - never a credential,
   header, or request body.

2. It records which ACP session methods Hermes itself handled, by wrapping the
   adapter class right after its module is imported. That is the direct
   observation of "how the stored Session was reopened" (``session/load`` vs
   ``session/resume`` vs a fresh ``session/new``) which the Server cannot see,
   because the reopen happens inside the Worker. Lines go to the file named by
   ``AGENTBOX_ACP_AUDIT``.

3. It applies the same reviewed deployment bootstrap the production artifact's
   own ``sitecustomize.py`` applies (``agentbox_hermes_bootstrap``), so the gate
   exercises the production start-up path rather than a gate-only variant.

A bootstrap failure is fatal (``SystemExit``), exactly as in production.
