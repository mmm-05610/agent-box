"""Category: 可选安装 / optional install — TARGET: the ACP schema the closure carries.

**This file is expected to fail today.** It is the install-side twin of
`tests/access/acp_passthrough_target.test.mjs`: the access tests say what the run
chain must do with an ACP frame; this says that the *bytes the optional installer
puts on disk* must actually be the schema version the adapter declares it speaks.
Baseline packaging facts stay green in `test_packaging_boundaries.py`, so a red here
is a real gap and never a lost baseline.

What is measured, read from `packaging/*/package.json` (`overrides`) and
`packaging/*/package-lock.json`:

    brand   root `overrides` the ACP sdk?   a closure member declares   lock resolves   verdict
    codex   yes → 1.3.0                     ^1.3.0 (codex-acp)          1.3.0           satisfied
    pi      yes → 1.3.0                     1.4.0    (pi-acp)           1.3.0           NOT satisfied
    claude  no                              —                            1.4.0 (flat)   n/a
    dsh     no                              —                            1.4.0 (flat)   n/a
    kilo    no                              —                            none present   n/a
    qwen    no                              —                            none present   n/a

Pi is the failure this file exists to report. Its root adds an `overrides` entry for
a package the root does not even depend on; npm applies overrides silently, so it
rewrites `@automatalabs/pi-acp@0.5.0`'s exact `"@agentclientprotocol/sdk": "1.4.0"`
down to `1.3.0`, `npm ci` exits 0, and the offline install hands the adapter a
protocol schema older than the one it was built against. Two findings are reported —
`acp_schema_pin_problems` from the lock (the symptom, what actually lands on disk)
and `acp_override_problems` from the manifest (the cause, which entry forced it) —
because fixing one without the other is exactly how this class of bug returns.
