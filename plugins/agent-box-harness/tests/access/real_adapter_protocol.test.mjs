/**
 * Category: 接入 ACP / native access — the fixtures are checked against a **real**
 * adapter's protocol, not against a protocol this repository wrote down.
 *
 * Why this file exists at all: every other test in this directory drives a fake.
 * A fake that invents a method name proves nothing about the boundary, so here the
 * real adapter is the oracle. Its bytes are on disk — `packaging/codex/vendor/
 * agentclientprotocol-codex-acp-1.1.14.tgz` is the tarball the optional install
 * would use — and an npm tarball is gzip plus 512-byte-header tar, which node can
 * read with `zlib` alone. Nothing is installed, downloaded or executed.
 *
 * What is asserted:
 *   1. the protocol tables (`AGENT_METHODS`, `CLIENT_METHODS`, `PROTOCOL_VERSION`)
 *      are read out of the real bundle, and are not empty;
 *   2. the controlled harness — the fake *Agent* every boundary test drives —
 *      never puts a method on the wire that the real adapter does not know;
 *   3. an inventory of which brands' protocol vocabulary is on disk, derived by
 *      reading files. This is the honest half: protocol coverage for OpenCode,
 *      Qwen Code and Hermes **cannot** be tested offline today, and a test that
 *      pretended otherwise would be worse than no test.
