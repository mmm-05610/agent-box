"""Work Order 114 item #6 / G5: the Qoder native-config key registry is honest.

Two properties the ticket demands, each one a gate:

* **register, don't invent** - every entry that is not understood carries no
  meaning and a first-hand source; no entry hands back a hallucinated
  interpretation;
* **register, don't drop** - a key the registry has never accounted for is
  *reported* by :func:`unregistered_keys`, not silently ignored.

The credential/privacy discipline is asserted too: the login state under
``.auth/`` is never a config key this materializer reaches for.
