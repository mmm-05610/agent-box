"""dsh production deployment template for the managed sidecar chain (non-secret).

Work Order 43's faithful clone of the Pi production template (see
`agent_box_harness.dsh/production.py`), for DeepSeek's official Harness
launcher `@deepseek-ai/dsh`. This module owns the dsh-specific parts of a
production deployment: which artifact directory carries the launcher and its
native dependency closure, how the product model id is spelled in the native
model catalogue, which environment variable carries the credential reference,
and which confined guest paths hold the native configuration and the native
session store.

It is deliberately *data*: the Server, Core, Worker and bwrap layers only ever
see the generic `runtimeArtifactMounts` / `projectionFiles` / `stateProjection`
/ `adapter` fields this template produces, and never a dsh branch.

The native configuration itself (`settings.yaml`) is checked in next to this
module under `deploy/dsh/`: one provider, the user-confirmed product model
`deepseek-flash`, the official DeepSeek root, a permissive default output ceiling
(order 108; a no-model gate pins its own bounded ceiling), and
thinking disabled. A test asserts the checked-in bytes against this module's
constants, so the template cannot drift into a second implementation. The
loopback endpoint a no-model gate uses is produced by replacing
`llm-deepseek.baseURL` alone.

Nothing here reads, stores, or emits credential content: the API key is an
environment *reference* (`$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`) resolved by dsh inside the
sandbox, where the Worker materialized it.

The guest layout is the common one every Harness uses: exactly one isolated
home root (`/runtime/home`) holds a read-only projection of the reviewed native
configuration and exactly one writable state directory

* read-only ``settings.yaml`` at ``/runtime/home/.dsh/settings.yaml``,
* writable ``/runtime/home/.dsh/sessions`` for dsh's own session store,
* ``DSH_HOME=/runtime/home/.dsh`` for both halves.

The dedicated variable and dsh's ``$HOME``-derived default (``/runtime/home``
is the guest ``HOME``, so ``~/.dsh`` resolves to the same directory) therefore
converge: nothing is copied into a writable home at run time, and the reviewed
file is the only configuration the process can read.
