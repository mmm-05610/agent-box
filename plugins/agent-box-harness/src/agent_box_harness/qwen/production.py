"""qwen production deployment template for the managed sidecar chain (non-secret).

Work Order 43's faithful clone of the dsh production template, for the Qwen
Code CLI started in its official ACP mode (`qwen --acp`). This module owns the
qwen-specific parts of a production deployment: the artifact directory carrying
the bundled CLI, the OpenAI-compatible endpoint and model the product selected,
the credential environment reference, and the confined guest paths for native
configuration and session state.

Verified first-hand over a live ACP probe: the OpenAI env trio
(`OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_MODEL`) drives the endpoint and
the wire model id end to end, and the adapter's `model` config option advertises
the runtime value `$runtime|openai|deepseek-flash(openai)` for that model. The
alias table translates the product id to exactly that advertised value.

There is no native configuration projection: qwen normalizes its settings
document at first boot (a read-only projection fails with EBUSY), and every
connection fact this deployment needs travels through the environment
(probe-verified). Nothing here reads, stores, or emits credential content: the
API key is an environment *reference* resolved inside the sandbox.

The guest layout is the common one: `/runtime/home` is the one isolated home
root; `QWEN_HOME=/runtime/home/.qwen` names the same directory dsh-style
double convergence (`$HOME/.qwen` resolves identically), the read-only
settings projection and the writable session store both live inside it.
