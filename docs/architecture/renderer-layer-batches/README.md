# Renderer layer — mechanical batches

One document per batch. Each is self-contained: an agent should be able to pick
up a single file and execute it without reading the others.

The analysis behind them — the layer rule, the four design knots, the full debt
table, and the candidates that look mechanical but are not — is
[`../renderer-layer-boundary.md`](../renderer-layer-boundary.md). Read it if you
are deciding *what* to do; read a batch document if you are doing it.

| batch | scope | edges paid off |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [01](01-lib-services-to-store.md) | four small stateful `lib/` services → `store/` | 6 |
| [02](02-tour-to-app.md) | `lib/tour/` → `app/tour/` | 2 |
| [03](03-project-session-moves.md) | a misplaced shape and a sidebar label | 3 |
| [04](04-workspace-groups-split.md) | split `workspace-groups.ts`, membership core → `store/` | 4 |
| | | **15** |

Fifteen of the 97 outstanding edges. The other 82 are concentrated in the design
knots described in
[`../renderer-layer-boundary.md`](../renderer-layer-boundary.md), not in more
batches like these.

## Batch 05 is a different objective

[`05-hermes-barrel-removal.md`](05-hermes-barrel-removal.md) removes the
`@/hermes` compatibility barrel. It pays off **no** ledger entry and is not part
of the 15 above — it is in this directory so the eventual policy document sees
the whole mechanical stack in one place, and because it shares this file's rules.

It has one ordering constraint that matters: it touches 240 files, so it must run
**entirely before or entirely after** batches 01–04, never interleaved. Batch 05's
own document argues for doing it first.

## Run them in order, one at a time

Not a style preference — two batches edit the same files. `01` and `03` both
repoint `app/session/hooks/use-session-actions/session-create.ts`, and every
batch regenerates the same ledger file. Sequential execution is what makes them
independent; running two at once will produce conflicts that look like bugs.

## The rules every batch shares

1. **Never widen the ledger.** It is the record of a problem, not a place to
   record permission. If a move needs an edge that is not already listed, stop
   and report — the batch is wrong, not the guard.
2. **Regenerate, do not hand-edit.** Every entry is keyed by the importer's path
   and the specifier as written, so any file that moves changes the ledger's
   contents. Run `npm run ledger:layers` from `apps/desktop` when the batch is
   done, and commit the result with the move.
3. **No behaviour change.** These are relocations. If a move turns out to need a
   signature change, a merge into an existing module, or a split, it does not
   belong in a mechanical batch — stop and report.
4. **Do not touch in-flight work.** `apps/desktop/src/agentbox/`,
   `apps/desktop/src/plugins/agentbox-lab/`,
   `docs/architecture/acp-desktop-phase1-design.md` and
   `docs/desktop-src-tree.md` are untracked work in progress. Never read,
   modify or stage them.
5. **Stage with explicit pathspecs.** Never `git add -A`, `git add .`, `git reset`
   or `git stash`. Stage the files the batch actually changed and nothing else.
6. **Keep lint clean, minimally.** Import order changes when a specifier changes.
   `npx eslint --fix` on the files the batch touched is fine, but check the
   resulting diff is import lines only — this config's `--fix` can also rewrite
   unrelated statements.

## How to verify any batch

```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm run typecheck
npm run test:ui                                     # renderer project
npx vitest run --project ui src/dev/contracts/renderer-layers.test.ts
npm run ledger:layers                               # then commit the ledger
npm run test:ui                                     # once more, ledger must not move
```

`test:ui` is the renderer project (772 files / 7,462 tests). Plain `npm test`
runs **both** vitest projects and will never match a renderer-only number; two
electron loopback tests fail environmentally there and are unrelated.

The second `test:ui` matters: if the ledger is stale, `renderer-layers.test.ts`
fails with "records no debt that has already been paid", and that failure is the
batch telling you it did not finish.
