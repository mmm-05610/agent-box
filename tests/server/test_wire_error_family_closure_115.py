"""Order 115 — the error-family misuse is **closed**, not patched at one call site.

Order 101 fixed the two call sites that were passing an internal code into
`WireError`'s family slot. It did not close the family: constructing a
`WireError` with anything unknown there raised `ValueError`, and the HTTP route
answers anything escaping `dispatch` with a bare status, so the client received
`HTTP 500` and twenty-one bytes of plain text instead of a JSON-RPC error object
(`QA-008`, `R-0052 ①(a)`). Any *new* call site could reintroduce exactly that,
and 101's unit gates could not see it.

Closure here has two structural halves, both inside `server/wire/**`:

    `errors.converge_family`   a value in the family slot is projected onto a
                               real family, original kept as `details.internalCode`
    `WireService.dispatch`     anything else a handler raises still leaves as a
                               compliant error object, with the exception's *type*
                               as `details.internalCode` and never its text

Everything here drives the real wire with `raise_server_exceptions=False`: a
client that re-raises server exceptions turns "500" into a traceback, which is
the disguise this family wears (101's note, and the reason its own gates missed
the boundary).
