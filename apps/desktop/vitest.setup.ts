// (`app/contrib/hooks/use-desktop-fs-connection.ts`); tests install the same one
// here so a test that sets `$connection` sees the branch it always did.
//
// Without this, every test that drives the adapter directly would silently take
// the LOCAL branch — the connection would read as absent — and 20-odd remote-mode
// assertions across the suite would fail on that, not on anything real. Wiring it
// centrally is also the honest shape: the app never runs unwired either.
