"""Order 118: an absent artifact must never read as "no failures, therefore green".

`QA-010` measured one pinned sha giving two answers on the same suite: with the
Worker artifacts missing, `18 failed / 961 passed / 21 skipped`; with only the
artifacts added back, `1 failed / 999 passed / 0 skipped`. The 21 skips were not
"skipped by design" - they were artifact-gated cases that never ran, and the
count line had no way to say so. `QA-007` asked a *human* to write a
"Worker 工件在/不在" line next to every count; this makes the *tool* write it.

Three classes, one default. A skip reason is classified as:

  ARTIFACT  a build product this repository owns (Worker binary, sidecar entry,
            the git-ignored npm closure) - missing means the claim was not tested
  TOOL      a host capability (bwrap, node, the claude CLI, a wsl.exe channel)
  DESIGN    the test says it is out of scope here (Windows ACL evidence, ...)

Anything the rules do not name is UNKNOWN, and UNKNOWN is never green: the
whole defect is "absence read as success", so absence-of-a-classification must
not be allowed to restore it (same reasoning as order 117's tri-state).

Usage:
    python3 scripts/server-round1/artifact_presence.py            # presence report
    python3 scripts/server-round1/artifact_presence.py --classify <log>
    python3 scripts/server-round1/artifact_presence.py --self-test
